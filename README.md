Convert H265/HEVC video codec to H264

For now, using codec h264_qsv because this is the fastest one for my computer which is only intel integrated graphic.

I use it mainly to convert anime episodes which are mostly HEVC and my phone & TV don't support this codec.
So there is a option to remove english dub because I don't like those.
